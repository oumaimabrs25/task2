                <li> <h2> The Birkin Bag</h2>  </li> <br>
                <img src="images/birkin.jpg" alt=" a picture of a birkin bag " width="300px ">
                <p> Named after Jane Birkin, this bag has been coveted since its inception in 1984. The BBC revealed how it came to be: "Its existence was a happy accident, borne out of an exchange between Birkin and former Hermès chief executive Jean-Louis Dumas on an Air France flight from Paris to London in the early '80s," the BBC wrote.

                <li> <h2>The Chanel Quilted Flap Bag </h2> </li> <br>
                <img src="images/chanel.jpg" alt=" a picture of a chanel bag " width="300px ">
                <p> Nothing says luxury like a Chanel bag. The quilted flap designs have been an integral part of the brand's history since Coco Chanel herself designed this bag in 1955.</p>

            <div id="alexField" class="bagsField" >
                <li> <h2>  The Mulberry Alexa </h2></li> <br>
                <img src="images/alex.jpg" alt=" a picture of a alex bag " width="300px ">
                <p> Having launched at the very start of the 2010s, Mulberry's Alexa bag—which was, of course, named after Alexa Chung—became an instant It bag. If you didn't have one, you wanted one.</p>

            <div id="gucciField" class="bagsField" >
                <li> <h2> The Gucci Jackie </h2></li>  <br>
                <img src="images/gucci.jpg" alt=" a picture of a gucci bag " width="300px ">
                <p> A handbag roundup is not complete without mentioning Gucci, and the brand's Jackie bag has become a classic. If you recognise the name, then it's probably because, technically, this bag isn't new.</p>

                <div id="diorField" class="bagsField" >
                <li> <h2> The Dior Saddle Bag</h2> </li>
                <img src="images/dior.jpg" alt=" a picture of a dior bag " width="300px ">
                <p> Dior's first Saddle Bag debuted in 1999 when John Galliano was still at the helm of the house, and its high resale value is proof that it's still coveted today. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Rihanna are among the celebrities who own this chic style.</p>
